# Brand Preset: `lamborghini`

Apply the `lamborghini`-inspired visual language to a project.

## How to Use

1. Read `DESIGN.md` in this folder in full. It is the complete specification: token values, component definitions, layout, elevation, responsive behaviour, and the do and do-not rules.
2. Copy its tokens into the semantic tier of the project token set. The frontmatter above repeats the core colour, type, and spacing values for quick lookup.
3. Build components from the `components` definitions in `DESIGN.md`. Do not invent variants it does not define.
4. Replace licensed typefaces with the fallbacks named in `DESIGN.md`.
5. Run `ui-code-linter` on the result. A preset sets the look; it does not waive contrast or accessibility rules.

## Boundaries

- This preset is a style reference for look and feel. Do not reproduce the company's logo, name, or trademarks, and do not present the result as that company's product.
- Where a preset value fails WCAG 2.2 AA contrast, adjust the value and record the change.
- For a style that is not tied to a company, use `skills/frontend/design-engineering/references/styles/token-packs/`.
