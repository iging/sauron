description: "| A terminal-native marketing system rendered entirely in Berkeley Mono  -  every word on the page, from the hero headline down to the footer fine print, is monospaced. The page itself reads like a manpage or a static-site README: warm cream canvas (`#fdfcfc`), nearly-black ink (`#201d1d`), 4px-radius rectangles for the few interactive elements, and bracketed `[+]`/`[-]` ASCII markers used as bullets. The brand's only \"visual moment\" is a single dark hero card that mocks up the OpenCode TUI itself  -  black background, monospaced terminal output, ASCII pipe characters, and a wordmark rendered as block-pixel ASCII. Every section sits as a hairline-bordered text block on the cream canvas with no shadows, no gradients, no decorative imagery, and no non-monospaced character anywhere in the system."

# Brand Preset: `opencode`

Apply the `opencode`-inspired visual language to a project.

## How to Use

1. Read `DESIGN.md` in this folder in full. It is the complete specification: token values, component definitions, layout, elevation, responsive behaviour, and the do and do-not rules.
2. Copy its tokens into the semantic tier of the project token set. The frontmatter above repeats the core colour, type, and spacing values for quick lookup.
3. Build components from the `components` definitions in `DESIGN.md`. Do not invent variants it does not define.
4. Replace licensed typefaces with the fallbacks named in `DESIGN.md`.
5. Run `ui-code-linter` on the result. A preset sets the look; it does not waive contrast or accessibility rules.

## Boundaries

- This preset is a style reference for look and feel. Do not reproduce the company's logo, name, or trademarks, and do not present the result as that company's product.
- Where a preset value fails WCAG 2.2 AA contrast, adjust the value and record the change.
- For a style that is not tied to a company, use `skills/frontend/design-engineering/references/styles/token-packs/`.
