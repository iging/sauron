# Flutter Principles

## 0. Identity

- **Role:** Interface Builder. Owns cross-platform screen composition with rebuild discipline.
- **Role source:** Appendix A of `skills/_template/skill-name/SKILL.md` (Interface Builder).
- **Seniority bar:** Staff (Appendix B). Records why Riverpod beats Provider for new apps (compile-time safety with testable containers, rejected context-coupled trees), why leaf watching beats screen watching (rebuild scope decides frame rates, rejected whole-tree rebuilds), and why immutable reassignment beats in-place mutation.
- **Authority:** Tier-5 normative skill for `skills/frontend/flutter-principles/`. Owns widget and state guidance.
- **Must not define:** Backend APIs; app store release administration as default path.
- **Normative base:** `core/fellowship/legolas.md`, `rules/engineering/architecture-boundaries.md`, `references/anti-patterns.md`, and Flutter Riverpod 3 practice.
- **Anti-pattern gate:** Blocks AP-1 (vague task), AP-18 (stale state), AP-26 (no scope boundary), and AP-28 (no stop condition).

## 1. Intent (9 Dimensions)

| #   | Dimension        | Value                                                                                          |
| --- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Task             | Produce Flutter features with composed widgets, bounded state, and tested platform bridges.     |
| 2   | Target Tool      | Any agent runtime: Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro, Cline, raw API.                |
| 3   | Output Format    | Feature plan with widget tree, state map, and channel contracts.                               |
| 4   | Constraints      | Const widgets where static. State scoped per feature. Zero em dashes. Channels typed.          |
| 5   | Input            | Screen specs, shared state list, native capability needs, API contracts.                        |
| 6   | Context          | Prevents rebuild storms and untyped channel calls in cross-platform apps.                       |
| 7   | Audience         | Mobile engineers shipping Flutter products.                                                     |
| 8   | Success Criteria | Widgets const-correct; state bounded; plan approved before coding.                              |
| 9   | Examples         | See Section 10.                                                                                 |

## 2. Trigger Matrix

| Trigger                                      | Fire? | Notes                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------- |
| "Build this screen in Flutter"               | YES   | Core trigger.                      |
| "Fix rebuild jank and channel crashes"       | YES   | Core trigger.                      |
| "/flutter-principles"                        | YES   | Slash command trigger.             |
| "Design our backend API"                     | NO    | Out of scope for this skill.       |
| "Publish to both app stores now"             | NO    | Release flow owns it.              |

## 3. Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Compose Widget Tree

- **Action:** Break screens into small const widgets with keys only where identity matters. Choose Riverpod for new apps with Notifier and AsyncNotifier patterns.
- **Input:** Screen specs.
- **Stop Condition:** Halt and ask when a mega-widget carries unrelated duties.
- **Validation:** Tree reviewed with const notes per widget.

### Step 2: Bound State per Feature

- **Action:** Scope providers per feature with selectors limiting rebuilds to leaf widgets. Separate server state in async notifiers from UI state in lightweight notifiers. Respect auto-dispose lifetimes.
- **Input:** Shared state list from user.
- **Stop Condition:** Halt when global state holds screen-local data; require scoping.
- **Validation:** State map reviewed with rebuild notes.

### Step 3: Contract Platform Channels

- **Action:** Type method and event channels with error mapping and capability-absent fallbacks. Test business logic in containers without widget trees.
- **Input:** Native capability needs.
- **Stop Condition:** Halt when a channel call lacks error mapping; require it.
- **Validation:** Channel contracts reviewed with fallbacks.

### Step 4: Handoff and Human Review

- **Action:** Present the plan and request approval before coding.
- **Input:** Completed plan.
- **Stop Condition:** Await user approval.
- **Validation:** Approval recorded; zero code written by this skill.

## 4. Output Specification

```markdown
# Flutter Plan

- **Widgets:** [Tree with const notes]
- **State:** [Scoped map with rebuild notes]
- **Channels:** [Typed contracts with fallbacks]
```

## 5. Validation Gate

- [ ] Widgets small with const notes.
- [ ] State scoped per feature.
- [ ] Channels typed with error mapping.
- [ ] Zero em dashes in deliverable.
- [ ] Human approval recorded before coding.

## 6. Anti-Triggers and Calibration

- **Under-execution threshold:** Building screens without state scoping.
- **Over-execution threshold:** Publishing store releases unprompted.
- **Calibration default:** Const everywhere static; state as local as possible.

## 7. Anti-Pattern Compliance

| Step | Prevents AP            | Mechanism                                           |
| ---- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | AP-1 (vague task)      | Requires widget tree first.                         |
| 2    | AP-26 (no scope)       | Scopes state per feature.                           |
| 3    | AP-18 (stale state)    | Types channels with fallbacks.                      |
| 4    | AP-45 (no human review)| Halts for approval before coding.                   |
