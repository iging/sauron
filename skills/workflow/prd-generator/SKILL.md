# PRD Generator

## 0. Identity

- **Role:** Master Planner. Owns vision extraction with relentless verification before requirements freeze.
- **Role source:** Appendix A of `skills/_template/skill-name/SKILL.md` (Master Planner).
- **Seniority bar:** Staff (Appendix B). Records why interview depth beats assumption speed (wrong PRDs cost quarters, rejected premature writing) and why codebase verification precedes every assertion.
- **Authority:** Owns requirement extraction, feature scoping, and PRD artifact generation.
- **Must not define:** Direct application implementation code; PRD does not include specific file paths or code snippets.
- **Normative base:** `core/fellowship/gandalf.md`, `rules/engineering/architecture-boundaries.md`, `references/anti-patterns.md`, and native template in `context/core-domains/product-requirements.md`.
- **Anti-pattern gate:** Blocks AP-1 (vague task), AP-3 (no success criteria), AP-16 (context dump), AP-28 (no stop condition), and AP-45 (no human review trigger).

## 1. Intent (9 Dimensions)

| #   | Dimension        | Value                                                                                                                              |
| --- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Task             | Interview the user, explore codebase context, resolve edge cases, and output a structured PRD markdown spec.                       |
| 2   | Target Tool      | Any agent runtime reading markdown skills: Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro, Cline, raw API.                           |
| 3   | Output Format    | Structured PRD Markdown document adhering to Section 4 Output Specification.                                                       |
| 4   | Constraints      | Never output PRD on first request without interviewing. No specific file paths or code snippets in final PRD.                      |
| 5   | Input            | User feature idea, spec request, or unorganized product outline.                                                                   |
| 6   | Context          | Prevents premature coding without defined requirements or architectural alignment.                                                 |
| 7   | Audience         | Product owners, engineering leads, and autonomous developer agents.                                                                |
| 8   | Success Criteria | PRD contains problem statement, solution, numbered user stories, module boundaries, testing strategy, and out-of-scope boundaries. |
| 9   | Examples         | See Section 10.                                                                                                                    |

## 2. Trigger Matrix

| Trigger                                              | Fire? | Notes                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Create a PRD for [feature]", "Spec out [component]" | YES   | Core trigger.                                                            |
| "I want to build a new feature, let's write a spec"  | YES   | Core trigger.                                                            |
| "Write the implementation code for auth"             | NO    | Implementation request; do not generate PRD unless explicitly requested. |
| "Fix this failing test in auth.ts"                   | NO    | Bug fix task; out of scope.                                              |

## 3. Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Requirements Extraction

- **Action:** Ask the user for a detailed description of the problem space, target actors, and intended solution.
- **Input:** User initial prompt.
- **Stop Condition:** Wait for user description before exploring.
- **Validation:** Problem statement and user goals are stated.

### Step 2: Context Verification

- **Action:** Search and explore the codebase to verify user assertions, existing architectural components, and data flow patterns.
- **Input:** Workspace files and codebase structure.
- **Stop Condition:** None.
- **Validation:** Codebase state is cross-referenced with user claims.

### Step 3: Relentless Interviewing

- **Action:** Interview the user about dependencies, edge cases, state management, and failure modes. Walk down each decision branch one by one.
- **Input:** User responses and codebase findings.
- **Stop Condition:** Pause and wait for user confirmation on ambiguous decisions.
- **Validation:** Dependencies resolved and shared understanding established.

### Step 4: Module & Testing Boundaries

- **Action:** Sketch major deep modules and external interfaces. Agree on testing strategy focusing on behavior rather than internal details.
- **Input:** Resolved requirements tree.
- **Stop Condition:** Wait for user agreement on module breakdown and testing philosophy.
- **Validation:** Module boundaries and test scope confirmed.

### Step 5: PRD Generation

- **Action:** Format the agreed requirements into the strict PRD Output Specification.
- **Input:** Verified requirements, user stories, module choices, and testing plan.
- **Stop Condition:** Present the completed PRD markdown block to the user.
- **Validation:** Output follows Section 4 template with zero specific file paths or code snippets.

## 4. Output Specification

Produce the PRD using the exact structure below. Output this as a standard markdown block.

```markdown
# Product Requirements Document

## Problem Statement

[The problem that the user is facing, from the user's perspective.]

## Solution

[The solution to the problem, from the user's perspective.]

## User Stories

[A LONG, numbered list of user stories covering all aspects of the feature.]

1. As an [actor], I want a [action], so that [value].

## Implementation Decisions

- **Modules Built/Modified:** [List of modules]
- **Interfaces Modified:** [List of interface changes]
- **Architectural/Schema/API Changes:** [List of contracts and schema updates]
  _(Note: No specific file paths or code snippets allowed)._

## Testing Decisions

- **Testing Philosophy:** [Description of what makes a good test for this feature]
- **Modules Tested:** [List of modules requiring tests]
- **Prior Art:** [References to similar types of tests in the codebase]

## Out of Scope

[Explicit description of things excluded from this PRD.]

## Further Notes

[Any additional context.]
```

## 5. Validation Gate

- [ ] Requirements extraction and interviewing occurred before document generation.
- [ ] Codebase context was explored and cross-referenced.
- [ ] PRD contains no specific file paths or raw code snippets.
- [ ] Output strictly matches Section 4 Output Specification structure.
- [ ] No application implementation code was generated.

## 6. Anti-Triggers and Calibration

- **Over-execution:** Do NOT execute this skill to write actual implementation code or pull requests. This skill strictly stops at generating the requirements document.
- **Under-execution:** Execute this skill immediately if a user provides a massive feature request but fails to provide a PRD. Force them through the interview process.
- **Calibration:** Ensure interviewing resolves edge cases without stalling on trivial wording choices.

## 7. Anti-Pattern Compliance

| Step | Prevents AP                     | Mechanism                                                                |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | AP-1 (vague task)               | Demands explicit problem and actor definitions.                          |
| 3    | AP-28 (no stop condition)       | Halts and waits for user confirmation on key decision branches.          |
| 4    | AP-26 (no scope boundary)       | Establishes explicit "Out of Scope" section and module boundaries.       |
| 5    | AP-45 (no human review trigger) | Delivers formatted PRD artifact for human sign-off before coding starts. |

## 10. Examples

**Input:** "Create a PRD for an offline-first habit tracking calendar."

**Output:**

```markdown
# Product Requirements Document

## Problem Statement

Users lose habit completion data when tracking offline or on weak cellular connections.

## Solution

An offline-first habit calendar storing logs locally in IndexedDB and syncing deterministically when network connectivity is restored.

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to mark habits complete offline so that my streak updates instantly.
2. As a user, I want background sync so that my data backs up automatically when reconnected.

## Implementation Decisions

- **Modules Built/Modified:** HabitStorageEngine, SyncScheduler, CalendarView
- **Interfaces Modified:** SyncProvider contract, StorageRepository
- **Architectural/Schema/API Changes:** Local event log schema with timestamp vector clock

## Testing Decisions

- **Testing Philosophy:** Behavior-driven tests asserting offline state persistence and conflict resolution.
- **Modules Tested:** HabitStorageEngine, SyncScheduler
- **Prior Art:** Existing offline cache unit tests.

## Out of Scope

Social habit sharing, group leaderboards, third-party analytics export.

## Further Notes

Initial release targets web and mobile web runtimes.
