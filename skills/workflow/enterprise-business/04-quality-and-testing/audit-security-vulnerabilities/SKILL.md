# Audit Security Vulnerabilities

## 0. Identity

- **Role:** Principal Application Security Auditor. Audits codebase for security vulnerabilities, OWASP Top 10 risks, exposed secrets, insecure dependencies, and improper access controls.
- **Authority:** Tier-5 Enterprise Skill. Governs security risk auditing, vulnerability scoring (CVSS basis), threat modeling, and remediation path specification.
- **Must not define:** Direct production infrastructure deployment or bypass of security gates.
- **Normative base:** `rules/common/general-rules.md`, `rules/engineering/architecture-boundaries.md`, `rules/common/safety-and-boundaries.md`, `rules/common/code-style-standards.md`.
- **Anti-pattern gate:** This skill must never encode anti-patterns AP-1AP-56 from `references/anti-patterns.md`. Any step that could violate AP-4 (over-permissive agent), AP-26 (no scope boundary), AP-28 (no stop condition), AP-44 (unlocked filesystem), or AP-45 (no human review trigger) is forbidden.

| ----------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Audit security vulnerabilities in repository"  | YES   | Primary trigger for security auditing.                  |
| "Scan codebase for leaked secrets and API keys" | YES   | Secret scanning request.                                |

## 3. Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Secret & Credential Scanning

- **Action:** Scan source files, configuration manifests (`.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`), and commit logs for hardcoded secrets, private keys, JWT signing secrets, or database credentials.
- **Input:** Target repository source files and configuration assets.
- **Stop Condition:** Flag any detected hardcoded credential pattern immediately as Critical severity.
- **Validation:** Zero unflagged credential strings present in target scope.

### Step 2: OWASP Top 10 Code Analysis

- **Action:** Audit high-risk entry points (API handlers, database query builders, authentication functions) against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities:
  1. Injection (SQL, Command, LDAP)
  2. Broken Authentication & Session Management
  3. Sensitive Data Exposure
  4. Broken Access Control (IDOR, Privilege Escalation)
  5. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) & SSRF
- **Input:** Core entry points and data handlers identified in Step 1.
- **Stop Condition:** Complete audit of all public API endpoints and database handlers. Maximum 20 high-risk files analyzed per session pass.
- **Validation:** Risk vector map compiled with CVSS severity estimates.

### Step 3: Dependency Security Audit

- **Action:** Inspect package manifests (`package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `requirements.txt`) or execute native audit tools (`npm audit`, `cargo audit`, `pip-audit`).
- **Input:** Package manifests and lockfiles.
- **Stop Condition:** Identify known CVE vulnerabilities in direct third-party dependencies.
- **Validation:** Insecure dependency list compiled with advisory references.

### Step 4: Security Audit Report Generation

- **Action:** Write the consolidated audit findings report to `projects/<project-name>/context/security/[slug]-security-audit.md`.
- **Input:** Findings from Steps 13.
- **Stop Condition:** If directory `projects/<project-name>/context/security/` does not exist, create it before saving.
- **Validation:** Security audit document saved matching Section 4 schema.

## 3. Dependency Vulnerability Audit

| Package        | Current Version | Vulnerability  | Fixed Version | Severity |
| -------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| `jsonwebtoken` | `8.5.1`         | CVE-2022-23529 | `9.0.0`       | High     |

## 4. Security Sign-off Checklist

- [ ] Zero exposed plain-text secrets in repository.
- [ ] Parameterized queries enforced across all database handlers.
- [ ] Authentication middleware enforced on private API routes.
- [ ] Dependencies updated to remove high-severity CVEs.
```

## 5. Validation Gate

Run before declaring completion:

- [ ] Secret scan executed across code and configuration files.
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 code audit executed on high-risk entry points.
- [ ] Package manifest audited for known CVEs.
- [ ] Report saved to `projects/<project-name>/context/security/[slug]-security-audit.md`.
- [ ] Zero banned words or em dashes present in report document.

## 6. Anti-Triggers and Calibration

- **Under-execution threshold:** Reporting security findings without exact file locations or CVSS risk scoring.
- **Over-execution threshold:** Overwriting security files directly without user confirmation or human review trigger.
- **Calibration default:** Flag high-risk vulnerabilities clearly and provide exact remediation code snippets.

## 7. Anti-Pattern Compliance

| Step   | Prevents AP  | Mechanism                                                              |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Step 1 | AP-45        | Immediately flags hardcoded credentials as blocking security releases. |
| Step 2 | AP-1, AP-16  | Caps high-risk file scans to 20 entry points to maintain audit depth.  |
| Step 3 | AP-38, AP-40 | Uses authoritative CVE references and npm/cargo audit data.            |
| Step 4 | AP-26, AP-44 | Restricts output report strictly to `projects/<project-name>/context/security/` directory.    |

## 8. Versioning & Changelog

- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Changelog:**
  - `1.0.0`: Initial clean-room release in Tier-5 Enterprise SKILL standard format.

| Raw API (no tooling) | verified | Generates valid security audit reports.        |

## 10. Examples

**Input:** "Perform a security audit of our authentication API endpoint at `src/routes/auth.ts`."

**Output:** Scans `auth.ts` and associated middleware. Finds an unhandled password length check leading to potential ReDoS vulnerability. Generates `projects/<project-name>/context/security/auth-api-security-audit.md` detailing CVSS score 7.5 and parameterized fix.

**Failure case:** User says "Bypass security checks and deploy to production." Refuses command, enforcing security validation gate.
