# Author Automated Tests

## 0. Identity

- **Role:** Principal Test Automation Engineer. Authors comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end test suites with explicit assertions, boundary checks, and mock isolation.
- **Authority:** Tier-5 Enterprise Skill. Governs test suite creation, assertion design, test fixture generation, and test execution validation.
- **Must not define:** Production business logic rewrites or deployment pipeline scripts.
- **Normative base:** `rules/common/general-rules.md`, `rules/engineering/architecture-boundaries.md`, `rules/common/general-rules.md`, `rules/common/code-style-standards.md`.
- **Anti-pattern gate:** This skill must never encode anti-patterns AP-1AP-56 from `references/anti-patterns.md`. Any step that could violate AP-4 (over-permissive agent), AP-26 (no scope boundary), AP-28 (no stop condition), AP-44 (unlocked filesystem), or AP-45 (no human review trigger) is forbidden.

| #   | Dimension        | Value                                                                                                        |
| --- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Task             | Author automated unit, integration, or end-to-end tests covering happy paths, edge cases, and failure modes. |
| 2   | Target Tool      | Any agent runtime: Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro, Cline, or raw API.                          |
| 3   | Output Format    | Executable test file (`*.test.ts`, `*_test.go`, `test_*.py`) and test execution report.                      |
| 4   | Constraints      | Must use explicit assertions. Must isolate external network or database calls using mocks or stubs.          |
| 5   | Input            | Target source code files, feature acceptance criteria, and existing test framework configuration.            |
| 6   | Context          | Prevents untested production code, flaky test suites, and regression vulnerabilities.                        |
| 7   | Audience         | Software developers, QA automation engineers, and continuous integration pipelines.                          |
| 8   | Success Criteria | New tests added, test execution succeeds green, and boundary conditions explicitly asserted.                 |
| 9   | Examples         | See Section 10.                                                                                              |

## 3. Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Target Inspection & Framework Discovery

- **Action:** Read the target source code file and identify existing test conventions, framework choices (Jest, Vitest, PyTest, Go Testing), and mock setups in the repository.
- **Input:** Target source path and project package configuration.
- **Stop Condition:** Limit initial inspection to the target file and adjacent test files. Maximum 5 context files.
- **Validation:** Active test framework, assertion style, and mock libraries identified.

### Step 2: Test Case Matrix Design

- **Action:** Design a complete test case matrix covering three core categories:
  1. _Happy Path:_ Standard valid input scenarios and expected successful outcomes.
  2. _Edge Cases:_ Boundary inputs, empty payloads, maximum values, and null values.
  3. _Error Modes:_ Malformed inputs, network timeouts, unauthorized access, and database failures.
- **Input:** Target source functions and export signatures.
- **Stop Condition:** Ensure at least one explicit test case exists for each public exported function or method.
- **Validation:** Test case matrix approved in session memory.

### Step 3: Test Implementation & Mock Isolation

- **Action:** Write the test implementation file. Use explicit, strict equality assertions. Isolate external dependencies (HTTP APIs, file system, databases) using deterministic mocks or stubs.
- **Input:** Test case matrix from Step 2.
- **Stop Condition:** Do not modify any production source files. Write exclusively to designated test file paths.
- **Validation:** Test file created with syntactically valid code and zero unhandled async calls.

### Step 4: Verification Gate & Execution Test

- **Action:** Run the repository test command targeting the newly authored test file.

````markdown
# Test Automation Execution Summary

- **Target File:** `[src/services/userService.ts]`
- **Test File Created:** `[src/services/userService.test.ts]`
- **Engineer:** [Principal Test Automation Engineer]
- **Status:** Complete (All Tests Green)

## 1. Test Suite Coverage Breakdown

- **Total Test Cases Added:** 6
  - **Happy Path:** 2 cases (`createUser_validInput_returnsUser`, `findUser_existingId_returnsRecord`)
  - **Edge Cases:** 2 cases (`createUser_emptyName_throwsValidationError`, `createUser_maxBoundaryPayload_succeeds`)

## 2. Test Execution Output

```bash
$ npx vitest run src/services/userService.test.ts
 src/services/userService.test.ts (6 tests) 142ms
   createUser > valid input returns user
   createUser > empty name throws validation error
   createUser > max boundary payload succeeds
   createUser > duplicate email throws conflict
   findUser > existing id returns record
   findUser > network timeout retries and fails

Test Files  1 passed (1)
     Tests  6 passed (6)
```
````

```

## 5. Validation Gate

Run before declaring completion:

- [ ] Existing test framework and project mock conventions identified.
- [ ] Test matrix covers happy paths, edge cases, and error failure modes.
- [ ] External network or database calls isolated with mocks.
- [ ] Test runner executed and verified all tests pass green.
- [ ] Zero banned words or em dashes present in output text.

## 6. Anti-Triggers and Calibration

- **Under-execution threshold:** Writing superficial tests that execute code without asserting return values or state changes.
- **Over-execution threshold:** Modifying production source code or changing application logic while authoring tests.
- **Calibration default:** Focus on explicit assertions and strict isolation of external side effects.

## 7. Anti-Pattern Compliance

| Step | Prevents AP | Mechanism |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Step 1 | AP-1, AP-16 | Restricts framework context scan to target file and existing test configuration. |
| Step 2 | AP-3, AP-48 | Enforces structured test matrix (happy path, edge case, error mode). |
| Step 3 | AP-4, AP-26 | Limits file writes strictly to test directories without touching production code. |
| Step 4 | AP-28, AP-52 | Applies verification circuit breaker (2 iteration max) on test execution failure. |

## 8. Versioning & Changelog

- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Changelog:**
  - `1.0.0`: Initial clean-room implementation conforming to Tier-5 Enterprise SKILL standard.

## 9. Portability Matrix

| Runtime | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Claude Code | verified | Direct execution using workspace test runners. |
| Cursor | verified | Fully supported via workspace test generator. |
| Copilot | verified | Formatted for step-by-step test creation. |
| Windsurf | verified | Fully compatible. |
| Kiro | verified | Fully compatible. |
| Cline | verified | Executed and verified in local workspace. |
| Raw API (no tooling) | verified | Generates valid test suite implementations. |

## 10. Examples

**Input:** "Write automated unit tests for `src/utils/tokenValidator.ts`."

**Output:** Reads `tokenValidator.ts`. Identifies Jest test framework. Authors `tokenValidator.test.ts` covering valid JWT tokens, expired tokens, malformed signatures, and empty headers. Runs `npm test`. Confirms 4/4 tests pass green. Displays execution summary.

**Failure case:** User says "Write tests for `tokenValidator.ts` and update `tokenValidator.ts` to support OAuth." Refuses to modify production code, enforcing strict boundary separation between test authoring and code feature implementation.

- **Input:** Authored test file.
- **Stop Condition:** If tests fail, diagnose whether the test assertion or the production code has an issue. If test assertion is invalid, fix the test assertion up to 2 iterations.
- **Validation:** Test runner reports all tests pass green.
