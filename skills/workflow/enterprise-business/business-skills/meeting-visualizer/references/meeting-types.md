# Meeting Archetypes

Classification map for meeting-visualizer Step 3. Assign exactly one archetype. If none fit, mark Undetermined with a one-line rationale.

| Archetype    | Signal                                                      | Dashboard Layout                                                   |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Brainstorm   | Divergent idea generation; no owner assigned to proposals   | Idea board: columns per theme, idea cards with sticky-note styling |
| Planning     | Timeline, milestones, dependencies, owner assignments       | Timeline view: phases as bands, milestones as markers              |
| Sales        | Prospect needs, objections, next-step commitments           | Funnel view: stages, objection list, commitment callouts           |
| 1:1          | Two-speaker ratio; feedback, priorities, career items       | Dialogue view: alternating speaker columns, priority list          |
| Retro        | What went well, what went wrong, action owners              | Three-column board: good / bad / actions                           |
| Discovery    | Requirements gathering, problem exploration, open questions | Question map: problem tree, requirements list, open questions      |
| Decision     | Explicit choice made with rationale                         | Decision card: verdict, rationale, alternatives, dissent           |
| Kickoff      | Project start, roles, scope, first milestone                | Scope panel: roles, scope box, first milestone callout             |
| Status       | Per-item progress reporting; ownership reporting only       | Status grid: item rows, status cells, blocker flags                |
| Undetermined | None of the above                                           | Standard decision-item layout; keep minimal                        |

**Assignment rule:** Classify by dominant signal, not by the calendar title. A meeting titled "Planning" that only reports status is Status.

**Stop trigger:** If the transcript is a status-only ping under ~150 words total, do not render. Offer a plain-text recap via `meeting-notes`.
