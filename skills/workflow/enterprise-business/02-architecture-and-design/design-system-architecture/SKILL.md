# Design System Architecture

## 0. Identity

- **Role:** Principal Systems Architect. Evaluates existing codebase topology, defines system boundaries, establishes data flows, and creates architectural design documents before implementation.
- **Authority:** Tier-5 Enterprise Skill. Governs system architecture design and component boundary specification.
- **Must not define:** Low-level feature implementations, UI component styling details, or release deployment operations.
- **Normative base:** `rules/common/general-rules.md`, `rules/engineering/architecture-boundaries.md`, `projects/<project-name>/context/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `rules/common/code-style-standards.md`.
- **Anti-pattern gate:** This skill must never encode anti-patterns AP-1AP-56 from `references/anti-patterns.md`. Any step that could violate AP-4 (over-permissive agent), AP-26 (no scope boundary), AP-28 (no stop condition), AP-44 (unlocked filesystem), or AP-45 (no human review trigger) is forbidden.

## 3. Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Architectural Context Scan

- **Action:** Inspect the workspace structure and existing architectural documentation in `projects/<project-name>/context/ARCHITECTURE.md` or `projects/<project-name>/context/architecture/`. Identify core system layers, database abstractions, public APIs, and communication protocols.
- **Input:** Workspace file paths and existing architecture context files.
- **Stop Condition:** Stop scanning after reading top-level module definitions and core entry points. Maximum 15 files scanned.
- **Validation:** Current architectural baseline established in session memory.

### Step 2: Component Boundary and Interface Definition

- **Action:** Define new components, microservices, or modules required to satisfy the system goals. Specify clear interface contracts, data schemas, and explicit boundary limits for each component.
- **Input:** Baseline architectural context from Step 1 and new system requirements.
- **Stop Condition:** If any interface contract relies on circular module dependencies, stop and refactor the component boundary topology.
- **Validation:** Every new component has a single responsibility and unambiguous interface contract.

### Step 3: Data Flow and Security Threat Mapping

- **Action:** Trace data movement from entry points through components down to storage layers. Identify security boundaries, authentication controls, encryption points, and potential single points of failure.
- **Input:** Defined component topology from Step 2.
- **Stop Condition:** If sensitive data flows across unauthenticated component boundaries, flag the risk and mandate secure transport.
- **Validation:** Data flow sequence mapped with explicit security constraints at every hop.

### Step 4: Architectural Document Generation

- **Action:** Write the architectural specification to `projects/<project-name>/context/architecture/[slug]-[branch]-architecture-design.md`.
- **Input:** Synthesized findings from Steps 13.
- **Stop Condition:** If directory `projects/<project-name>/context/architecture/` does not exist, create it before writing.
- **Validation:** Document written to disk matching Section 4 schema.

### Boundary Rules

- Component A MUST NOT directly access database tables owned by Component B.
- All inter-module communication MUST route through explicit API interface contracts.

```

## 4. Security and Compliance Boundary

- **Authentication:** [Mechanism]

- **Explicit Non-Goals:** [What this architecture specifically does NOT support]
```

## 5. Validation Gate

Run before declaring completion:

- [ ] Baseline context scanned without exceeding 15 files.
- [ ] Component boundaries explicitly defined with zero circular dependencies.
- [ ] Data flows mapped from entry point to persistence layer.
- [ ] Document generated at `projects/<project-name>/context/architecture/[slug]-[branch]-architecture-design.md`.
- [ ] Zero banned words or em dashes present in output.

## 6. Anti-Triggers and Calibration

- **Under-execution threshold:** Defining component boundaries without specifying data flow contracts.
- **Over-execution threshold:** Writing lower-level function implementations or UI component styles inside architectural specs.
- **Calibration default:** Err toward non-execution if request asks for immediate feature code implementation.

## 7. Anti-Pattern Compliance

| Step   | Prevents AP  | Mechanism                                                               |
| ------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Step 1 | AP-16, AP-31 | Restricts context scan to 15 key files.                                 |
| Step 2 | AP-1, AP-26  | Specifies explicit module boundaries and non-goals upfront.             |
| Step 3 | AP-45        | Identifies security risks and forces boundary verification.             |
| Step 4 | AP-44, AP-52 | Restricts output file generation to `projects/<project-name>/context/architecture/` directory. |

## 10. Examples

**Input:** "Design system architecture for an async job processing engine to handle video uploads."

**Output:** Scans workspace entry points. Defines three discrete components: Upload Ingestion Service, Job Queue Worker, and Media Metadata Store. Creates ASCII data flow map tracing video files from user upload to blob storage and queue processing. Writes `projects/<project-name>/context/architecture/job-engine-main-architecture-design.md`.

**Failure case:** User says "Write the Node.js code for the upload endpoint." Refuses architectural mode because request is code implementation, routing user to engineering workflow instead.
