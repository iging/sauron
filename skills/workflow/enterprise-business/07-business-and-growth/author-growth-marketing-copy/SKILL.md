# Author Growth Marketing Copy

## 0. Identity

- **Role:** Lead Technical Growth & Product Marketing Copywriter. Drafts technical product release announcements, developer landing page copy, feature launch posts, and value proposition messaging.
- **Authority:** Tier-5 Enterprise Skill. Governs technical product copy, feature announcement posts, value proposition framing, and developer-facing launch messaging.
- **Must not define:** Source code implementations or false technical capabilities.
- **Normative base:** `rules/common/general-rules.md`, `rules/engineering/architecture-boundaries.md`, `rules/common/code-style-standards.md`.
- **Anti-pattern gate:** This skill must never encode anti-patterns AP-1AP-56 from `references/anti-patterns.md`. Any step that could violate AP-4 (over-permissive agent), AP-26 (no scope boundary), AP-28 (no stop condition), AP-44 (unlocked filesystem), or AP-45 (no human review trigger) is forbidden.

## 1. Intent (9 Dimensions)

| #   | Dimension        | Value                                                                                               |
| --- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Task             | Draft developer-facing product launch copy, landing page headlines, and feature announcements.      |
| 2   | Target Tool      | Any agent runtime: Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro, Cline, or raw API.                 |
| 3   | Output Format    | Growth marketing copy document saved to `projects/<project-name>/context/marketing/[slug]-launch-copy.md`.                 |
| 4   | Constraints      | Must follow spartan writing rules. Zero hype, zero banned words, zero em dashes, zero fluff.        |
| 5   | Input            | Feature specification, technical architecture highlights, target developer persona, launch channel. |
| 6   | Context          | Prevents marketing buzzword overload, dishonest claims, and low-converting launch copy.             |
| 7   | Audience         | Developers, technical decision makers, engineering leads, and adopters.                             |
| 8   | Success Criteria | Technical copy delivered highlighting concrete features, code examples, and clear call-to-action.   |
| 9   | Examples         | See Section 10.                                                                                     |

## 2. Trigger Matrix

| Trigger                                      | Fire? | Notes                                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------ |
| "Write feature launch announcement for v2.0" | YES   | Primary trigger for launch copy authoring. |
| "Draft developer landing page copy"          | YES   | Landing page copy request.                 |
| "Author release notes blog post"             | YES   | Product announcement request.              |
| "Fix bug in auth middleware"                 | NO    | Engineering task. Route to debugging.      |
| "Deploy to Kubernetes cluster"               | NO    | Ops task. Route to release engineering.    |

## 3. Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Feature & Developer Persona Mapping

- **Action:** Inspect the feature specification or release summary. Identify the target developer persona, primary technical pain point solved, key architecture highlights, and concrete developer benefits.
- **Input:** Target spec file (`projects/<project-name>/context/specs/*`) or release summary (`projects/<project-name>/context/releases/*`).
- **Stop Condition:** Limit feature inspection to assigned release or spec files. Maximum 5 context files.
- **Validation:** Developer pain point, technical solution, and target persona locked.

### Step 2: Value Proposition & Code Example Framing

- **Action:** Draft core value proposition headline and sub-headline. Frame the technical capability using concrete code snippets or API usage examples.
- **Input:** Target persona and feature highlights from Step 1.
- **Stop Condition:** Reject vague adjectives (for example, promotional hype words). Replace with concrete technical metrics (for example, "reduces query latency from 200ms to 12ms").
- **Validation:** Value proposition framed with concrete code example.

### Step 3: Copy Generation & Rule Compliance Check

- **Action:** Write the launch copy payload including headline, sub-headline, technical highlights, code snippet, and clear call-to-action (CTA). Apply strict spartan prose filters.
- **Input:** Framed value proposition from Step 2.
- **Stop Condition:** Enforce writing constraints: zero banned marketing terms, zero em dashes, zero semicolons in prose.
- **Validation:** Copy generated matching Section 4 schema with zero banned word violations.

### Step 4: Marketing Copy Artifact Delivery

- **Action:** Save the completed launch copy to `projects/<project-name>/context/marketing/[slug]-launch-copy.md`.
- **Input:** Verified copy payload from Step 3.
- **Stop Condition:** If directory `projects/<project-name>/context/marketing/` does not exist, create it before saving.
- **Validation:** Launch copy document saved to target path.

## 4. Output Specification

````markdown
# Developer Product Launch Copy: [Feature / Product Name]

- **Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Copywriter:** [Lead Technical Growth & Product Marketing Copywriter]
- **Target Audience:** Backend Engineers | Frontend Developers | DevOps
- **Copy Path:** `projects/<project-name>/context/marketing/[slug]-launch-copy.md`

## 1. Landing Page Headline & Sub-Headline

### Headline

Run Sub-Millisecond Database Queries Across Distributed Regions

### Sub-Headline

Connect your TypeScript application to geographically distributed read replicas with zero configuration changes.

## 2. Code-First Technical Feature Highlights

### 1. Automatic Connection Pooling

- **Problem:** Database connection limits choked during traffic spikes.
- **Solution:** Integrated connection pool manager maintains steady 100-connection limit.

```typescript
import { connectPool } from "@company/db";
const db = await connectPool({ maxConnections: 100 });
```
````

### 2. Built-in Prepared Statement Caching

- **Problem:** Repeated query parsing added 15ms overhead per request.
- **Solution:** Automatic statement cache reduces query overhead to under 1ms.

## 3. Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)

- **Primary CTA:** Install package via `npm install @company/db`
- **Secondary CTA:** Read the 5-minute integration guide at `https://docs.company.com/quickstart`

## 4. Banned Words Compliance Checklist

- [x] Zero banned words (`craft`, `delve`, `innovative`, `skyrocket`, `utilize`).
- [x] Zero em dashes in body text.
- [x] Zero unverified marketing claims.

```

## 5. Validation Gate

Run before declaring completion:

- [ ] Target developer persona and technical pain points mapped.
- [ ] Concrete code snippets included alongside technical feature claims.
- [ ] Strict spartan writing rules enforced (zero banned words, zero em dashes).
- [ ] Copy saved to `projects/<project-name>/context/marketing/[slug]-launch-copy.md`.
- [ ] Zero unverified hype or marketing buzzwords present.

## 6. Anti-Triggers and Calibration

- **Under-execution threshold:** Writing marketing copy without technical specifics, code snippets, or benchmark numbers.
- **Over-execution threshold:** Overpromising unbuilt product capabilities or inventing false technical benchmarks.
- **Calibration default:** Keep copy concise, technical, code-first, and spartan.

## 7. Anti-Pattern Compliance

| Step | Prevents AP | Mechanism |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Step 1 | AP-1, AP-16 | Caps context scan to 5 spec or release files. |
| Step 2 | AP-38, AP-40 | Requires concrete code snippets and benchmark numbers instead of adjectives. |
| Step 3 | AP-42 | Enforces spartan prose rules and filters banned words automatically. |
| Step 4 | AP-26, AP-44 | Restricts output report strictly to `projects/<project-name>/context/marketing/` directory. |

## 8. Versioning & Changelog

- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Changelog:**
  - `1.0.0`: Initial clean-room implementation conforming to Tier-5 Enterprise SKILL standard.

## 9. Portability Matrix

| Runtime | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Claude Code | verified | Direct execution using standard workspace tools. |
| Cursor | verified | Fully supported via copywriter workflow. |
| Copilot | verified | Formatted for developer marketing copy generation. |
| Windsurf | verified | Fully compatible. |
| Kiro | verified | Fully compatible. |
| Cline | verified | Executed and verified in local workspace. |
| Raw API (no tooling) | verified | Generates valid developer launch copy. |

## 10. Examples

**Input:** "Author product launch copy for our new CLI tool that automates database schema migrations."

**Output:** Reads CLI feature spec. Drafts landing page headline "Automate PostgreSQL Migrations in 1 Command". Includes code example showing `npx migrate-cli up`. Eliminates buzzwords. Saves copy to `projects/<project-name>/context/marketing/cli-migration-tool-launch-copy.md`.

**Failure case:** User says "Write launch copy using exaggerated marketing hype words." Refuses hype words, replacing with spartan technical metrics.
