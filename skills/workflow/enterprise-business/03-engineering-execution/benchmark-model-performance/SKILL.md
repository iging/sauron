# Benchmark Model Performance

## 0. Identity

- **Role:** Machine Learning Performance Engineer. Evaluates model execution latencies, resource consumption, token usage, and inference quality across comparative model runs.
- **Authority:** Tier-5 Enterprise Skill. Governs model performance measurement, token usage tracking, and latency benchmarking.
- **Must not define:** Application UI layout or business logic specifications.
- **Normative base:** `rules/common/general-rules.md`, `rules/engineering/architecture-boundaries.md`, `rules/common/code-style-standards.md`.
- **Anti-pattern gate:** This skill must never encode anti-patterns AP-1AP-56 from `references/anti-patterns.md`. Any step that could violate AP-4 (over-permissive agent), AP-26 (no scope boundary), AP-28 (no stop condition), AP-44 (unlocked filesystem), or AP-45 (no human review trigger) is forbidden.

## 3. Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Benchmark Suite Configuration & Dataset Load

- **Action:** Read the target model configuration, prompt dataset, and evaluation parameters. Confirm model API keys or endpoints are active.
- **Input:** Benchmark configuration file or prompt dataset paths.
- **Stop Condition:** If model endpoints are unreachable or invalid, stop and notify you to provide active credentials.
- **Validation:** Test environment and target model endpoints confirmed active.

### Step 2: Execution and Telemetry Capture

- **Action:** Execute the benchmark prompt suite against target models across multiple runs (minimum 3 warm-up runs, minimum 10 sample runs per prompt). Record time-to-first-token (TTFT), inter-token latency, total latency, input tokens, and output tokens.
- **Input:** Benchmark dataset and configured model endpoints from Step 1.
- **Stop Condition:** If error rate exceeds 5%, halt execution and report endpoint instability.
- **Validation:** Raw telemetry captured for all sample runs.

### Step 3: Statistical Synthesis & Percentile Calculation

- **Action:** Process captured telemetry. Compute median (p50), 95th percentile (p95), 99th percentile (p99) latencies, tokens per second, and estimated financial cost per 1,000 queries.
- **Input:** Telemetry data from Step 2.
- **Stop Condition:** Exclude outlier runs that timed out due to network failures from percentile calculations while logging total error count.
- **Validation:** Complete statistical summary table generated.

### Step 4: Benchmark Report Generation

- **Action:** Save the benchmark performance report to `projects/<project-name>/context/benchmarks/[slug]-benchmark-report.md`.
- **Input:** Statistical summary from Step 3.
- **Stop Condition:** If directory `projects/<project-name>/context/benchmarks/` does not exist, create it before saving.
- **Validation:** Report document saved matching Section 4 schema.

## 3. Financial & Resource Cost Analysis

- **Model A Estimated Cost / 1k Invocations:** $0.45
- **Model B Estimated Cost / 1k Invocations:** $1.20

## 4. Performance Recommendation

- **Recommended Choice:** [Model A]
- **Justification:** Model A delivers 2x higher token throughput and lower p95 latency at 62% lower cost.
```

## 5. Validation Gate

Run before declaring completion:

- [ ] Model endpoint connectivity verified before starting full suite.
- [ ] Minimum 10 iterations per prompt executed for statistical significance.
- [ ] Percentiles (p50, p95, p99) and token throughput calculated accurately.
- [ ] Benchmark report saved to `projects/<project-name>/context/benchmarks/[slug]-benchmark-report.md`.
- [ ] Zero banned words or em dashes present in report document.

## 6. Anti-Triggers and Calibration

- **Under-execution threshold:** Reporting single-run latency numbers without computing percentiles or statistical variance.
- **Over-execution threshold:** Attempting to retrain model weights or rewrite backend inference code during a benchmark run.
- **Calibration default:** Focus strictly on accurate telemetry collection and statistical presentation.

## 7. Anti-Pattern Compliance

| Step   | Prevents AP  | Mechanism                                                              |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Step 1 | AP-1, AP-28  | Verifies active endpoints before starting batch runs.                  |
| Step 2 | AP-11        | Mandates multi-run sampling (10 runs) to eliminate noise.              |
| Step 3 | AP-38, AP-40 | Computes exact percentile statistics rather than subjective estimates. |
| Step 4 | AP-26, AP-44 | Restricts output report strictly to `projects/<project-name>/context/benchmarks/` directory.  |

## 10. Examples

**Input:** "Benchmark model performance comparing Claude Sonnet and GPT-4o on our customer support prompt set."

**Output:** Runs 10 samples per prompt against both APIs. Measures TTFT and throughput. Calculates p50 and p95 latencies. Calculates estimated cost. Saves report to `projects/<project-name>/context/benchmarks/support-prompts-sonnet-vs-4o.md`.

**Failure case:** User says "Estimate which model is faster without running any benchmark requests." Refuses to guess without data, enforcing execution of benchmark suite.
