# Write Code Implementation

## 0. Identity

- **Role:** Lead Software Engineer. Translates approved feature specifications and architectural designs into production-ready source code adhering to repository clean-code standards.
- **Authority:** Tier-5 Enterprise Skill. Governs production code generation, bug resolution coding, and unit test alignment within assigned scope boundaries.
- **Must not define:** Product requirements, deployment pipeline changes, or release tag creation.
- **Normative base:** `rules/common/general-rules.md`, `rules/engineering/architecture-boundaries.md`, `rules/common/general-rules.md`, `rules/common/code-style-standards.md`.
- **Anti-pattern gate:** This skill must never encode anti-patterns AP-1AP-56 from `references/anti-patterns.md`. Any step that could violate AP-4 (over-permissive agent), AP-26 (no scope boundary), AP-28 (no stop condition), AP-44 (unlocked filesystem), or AP-45 (no human review trigger) is forbidden.

## 1. Intent (9 Dimensions)

| #   | Dimension        | Value                                                                                                  |
| --- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Task             | Write production code and unit tests matching an approved feature specification or ticket.             |
| 2   | Target Tool      | Any agent runtime: Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro, Cline, or raw API.                    |
| 3   | Output Format    | Modified source code files, new test files, and concise execution summary.                             |
| 4   | Constraints      | Must read feature spec before writing code. Must edit only allowed scope files. Must run verification. |
| 5   | Input            | Feature specification file, issue description, target files, and repository coding rules.              |
| 6   | Context          | Prevents out-of-scope edits, architectural drift, and untested production code additions.              |
| 7   | Audience         | Software developers, pull request reviewers, and continuous integration pipelines.                     |
| 8   | Success Criteria | Code implemented adhering to spec boundaries, type checker passes, and unit tests pass.                |
| 9   | Examples         | See Section 10.                                                                                        |

## 2. Trigger Matrix

| Trigger                           | Fire? | Notes                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| "Implement code for spec X"       | YES   | Primary trigger for feature coding.      |
| "Build this API endpoint"         | YES   | Core feature implementation request.     |
| "Write code to fulfill issue #42" | YES   | Ticket execution request.                |
| "Brainstorm business strategy"    | NO    | Discovery task. Route to product demand. |
| "Review this pull request"        | NO    | Code review task. Route to code review.  |

## 3. Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Specification Pre-Check and Scope Lock

- **Action:** Read the target feature specification or ticket description. Identify allowed file edit boundaries, forbidden file paths, and acceptance criteria.
- **Input:** Feature specification path (`projects/<project-name>/context/specs/*`) or user task input.
- **Stop Condition:** If no explicit scope boundary exists, ask you to confirm allowed target files before editing.
- **Validation:** Allowed file paths locked in session memory.

### Step 2: Test-Driven Baseline Setup

- **Action:** Inspect existing test files or write a failing unit test that exercises the required new capability. Run the test to confirm baseline failure.
- **Input:** Target test directory and feature acceptance criteria.
- **Stop Condition:** If existing test suite fails prior to changes, notify you and resolve test baseline before feature coding.
- **Validation:** Test baseline confirmed red (failing) for the new requirement.

### Step 3: Production Code Implementation

- **Action:** Implement minimal, high-quality production source code to satisfy the feature requirements. Follow repository code conventions in `rules/common/general-rules.md` (clean functions, strict typing, zero unused parameters).
- **Input:** Target source files locked in Step 1.
- **Stop Condition:** Do not edit files outside the locked scope boundaries. Limit edits strictly to allowed paths.
- **Validation:** Source code written without syntax or type errors.

### Step 4: Verification and Green Gate

- **Action:** Execute the local verification command (for example, `npm test`, `pytest`, `go test`, `cargo test`) and type checker.
- **Input:** Updated source code and test files.
- **Stop Condition:** If test or type check fails, iterate on implementation up to 3 times. If still failing, revert changes and present diagnosis.
- **Validation:** All tests pass green. Type checker reports zero errors.

## 4. Output Specification

````markdown
# Engineering Implementation Summary: [Feature Title]

- **Status:** Complete | Failed Verification
- **Engineer:** [Lead Software Engineer]
- **Target Spec:** `projects/<project-name>/context/specs/[slug]-feature-spec.md`

## 1. Files Modified

- `[src/path/file1.ts]`: Added core implementation logic.
- `[src/path/file1.test.ts]`: Added unit test coverage for new edge cases.

## 2. Verification Results

```bash
$ npm test
PASS src/path/file1.test.ts (2.1 s)
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       4 passed, 4 total
```
````

## 3. Scope Boundary Compliance Check

- [x] All edits confined to allowed target paths.
- [x] Zero changes to forbidden files (`package.json`, database migrations).
- [x] Zero unused imports or dead code introduced.

```

## 5. Validation Gate

Run before declaring completion:

- [ ] Target specification read and scope boundaries locked.
- [ ] Edits confined strictly to allowed file paths.
- [ ] Unit tests added or updated to cover new functionality.
- [ ] Verification command executed and reported green.
- [ ] Zero banned words or em dashes present in response text.

## 6. Anti-Triggers and Calibration

- **Under-execution threshold:** Modifying source files without executing tests or type checks to verify changes.
- **Over-execution threshold:** Refactoring unrelated subsystems or modifying global architecture during a focused feature ticket.
- **Calibration default:** Err toward smallest viable diff to pass test criteria.

## 7. Anti-Pattern Compliance

| Step | Prevents AP | Mechanism |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Step 1 | AP-4, AP-26 | Locks explicit file edit boundaries before modifying codebase. |
| Step 2 | AP-3, AP-48 | Enforces test-first or test-aligned verification gate. |
| Step 3 | AP-2, AP-14 | Keeps implementation strictly within single-task boundaries. |
| Step 4 | AP-28, AP-52 | Implements circuit breaker (3 iteration max) on verification failure. |

## 8. Versioning & Changelog

- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Changelog:**
  - `1.0.0`: Initial clean-room implementation conforming to Tier-5 Enterprise SKILL standard.

## 9. Portability Matrix

| Runtime | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Claude Code | verified | Direct execution using standard file and terminal tools. |
| Cursor | verified | Fully supported via workspace editor. |
| Copilot | verified | Formatted for step-by-step coding guidance. |
| Windsurf | verified | Fully compatible. |
| Kiro | verified | Fully compatible. |
| Cline | verified | Executed and verified in workspace environment. |
| Raw API (no tooling) | verified | Generates valid code diffs and implementation steps. |

## 10. Examples

**Input:** "Implement the login rate limiter spec at `projects/<project-name>/context/specs/auth-rate-limiter.md`."

**Output:** Reads spec file. Locks scope to `src/middleware/rateLimit.ts` and `src/middleware/rateLimit.test.ts`. Writes rate limiter middleware. Executes `npm test`. Confirms all 4 tests pass green. Displays execution summary.

**Failure case:** User says "Refactor the database migrations while implementing the login rate limiter." Refuses out-of-scope database migration edit, enforcing scope lock.
