# Refactor Clean Code

## 0. Identity

- **Role:** Principal Software Refactoring Engineer. Restructures existing source code to improve maintainability, readability, and performance without altering external system behavior.
- **Authority:** Tier-5 Enterprise Skill. Governs behavior-preserving code refactoring and structural cleanup.
- **Must not define:** New feature additions or public API breaking changes.
- **Normative base:** `rules/common/general-rules.md`, `rules/engineering/architecture-boundaries.md`, `rules/common/general-rules.md`, `rules/common/code-style-standards.md`.
- **Anti-pattern gate:** This skill must never encode anti-patterns AP-1AP-56 from `references/anti-patterns.md`. Any step that could violate AP-4 (over-permissive agent), AP-26 (no scope boundary), AP-28 (no stop condition), AP-44 (unlocked filesystem), or AP-45 (no human review trigger) is forbidden.

| --- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Task             | Restructure code to eliminate smells (long methods, duplicate logic, high complexity) preserving behavior. |
| 2   | Target Tool      | Any agent runtime: Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro, Cline, or raw API.                        |
| 3   | Output Format    | Refactored source code diffs and test suite execution verification logs.                                   |
| 4   | Constraints      | Must verify green test suite before and after refactoring. Zero external behavior changes allowed.         |
| 5   | Input            | Target source file paths, existing unit test suite, and repository clean-code rules.                       |
| 6   | Context          | Prevents code decay, technical debt accumulation, and unverified breaking refactors.                       |
| 7   | Audience         | Software engineers and code reviewers.                                                                     |

## 3. Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Safety Baseline & Test Suite Verification

- **Action:** Run existing automated unit and integration tests for the target code paths. Verify that all tests pass green before touching source files.
- **Input:** Target source files and associated test suite.
- **Stop Condition:** If tests are missing or failing, write or fix tests to establish a green safety baseline before refactoring.
- **Validation:** Test baseline confirmed 100% green.

### Step 2: Code Smell Identification & Strategy Selection

- **Action:** Inspect target files against `rules/common/general-rules.md` clean-code guidelines. Identify specific code smells (for example, functions over 30 lines, nested conditionals, duplicate logic, magic numbers). Select standard refactoring patterns (Extract Function, Replace Conditional with Polymorphism, Inline Temp).
- **Input:** Baseline source code from Step 1.
- **Stop Condition:** Limit refactoring scope to identified code smells inside specified files. Do not alter public exported function signatures.
- **Validation:** Clear list of targeted code smells and selected refactoring patterns established.

### Step 3: Incremental Refactoring Execution

- **Action:** Apply refactoring patterns in small, atomic steps. Re-run tests after every individual transformation to verify behavior preservation.
- **Input:** Identified smells and refactoring plan from Step 2.
- **Stop Condition:** If any atomic step causes a test failure, revert that step immediately and choose an alternative approach.
- **Validation:** Source code refactored cleanly with zero test failures.

### Step 4: Verification and Metrics Comparison

- **Action:** Run full repository test suite and static analysis tools. Compare cyclomatic complexity, line counts, and readability before and after.
- **Input:** Refactored codebase.
- **Stop Condition:** Stop after displaying metrics comparison and green test results.
- **Validation:** Tests pass green. Cyclomatic complexity or line count reduced.

## 4. Output Specification

````markdown
# Refactoring Execution Summary

- **Target File:** `[src/path/targetFile.ts]`
- **Engineer:** [Principal Software Refactoring Engineer]
- **Status:** Completed | Reverted

## 1. Code Smells Eliminated

- **Smell 1:** Long monolithic function (`calculateTaxRate`, 95 lines) -> Extracted into 3 focused helper functions.
- **Smell 2:** Nested ternary operators -> Replaced with explicit guard clauses.
- **Smell 3:** Duplicate validation logic -> Consolidated into `validateAddress()`.

## 2. Refactoring Metrics Comparison

| Metric                       | Before | After | Improvement             |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ----- | ----------------------- |
| Total Lines of Code          | 340    | 260   | -23.5%                  |
| Max Cyclomatic Complexity    | 18     | 6     | -66.7%                  |
| Public API Signature Changes | 0      | 0     | 0% (Behavior Preserved) |

## 3. Verification Command Output

```bash
$ npm test src/path/targetFile.test.ts
PASS src/path/targetFile.test.ts (1.8 s)
12 tests passed, 0 failed.
```
````

```

## 5. Validation Gate

Run before declaring completion:

- [ ] Green test baseline verified prior to refactoring.
- [ ] Refactoring executed in atomic steps with zero public API signature changes.
- [ ] Code complexity and line count reduced.
- [ ] Final verification command executed and reported green.
- [ ] Zero banned words or em dashes present in output.

## 6. Anti-Triggers and Calibration

- **Under-execution threshold:** Renaming variables without restructuring complex logic or reducing cyclomatic complexity.
- **Over-execution threshold:** Changing public API contracts or adding unrequested features during a refactoring task.
- **Calibration default:** Prioritize safety and behavior preservation over aggressive stylistic rewrites.

## 7. Anti-Pattern Compliance

| Step | Prevents AP | Mechanism |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Step 1 | AP-3, AP-48 | Mandates green test baseline before modifying code. |
| Step 2 | AP-4, AP-26 | Forbids public API breaking changes or scope expansion. |
| Step 3 | AP-28, AP-52 | Applies immediate rollback on test failure during atomic steps. |
| Step 4 | AP-42 | Delivers clear metrics proof of behavior preservation. |

## 8. Versioning & Changelog

- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Changelog:**
  - `1.0.0`: Initial clean-room implementation conforming to Tier-5 Enterprise SKILL standard.

## 9. Portability Matrix

| Runtime | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Claude Code | verified | Direct execution using standard workspace tools. |
| Cursor | verified | Fully supported via workspace editor. |
| Copilot | verified | Formatted for step-by-step refactoring guidance. |
| Windsurf | verified | Fully compatible. |
| Kiro | verified | Fully compatible. |
| Cline | verified | Executed and verified in local workspace. |
| Raw API (no tooling) | verified | Generates valid refactoring diffs. |

## 10. Examples

**Input:** "Refactor `orderCalculator.ts` to reduce complexity and remove duplicate code."

**Output:** Runs `npm test orderCalculator.test.ts`. Confirms all 8 tests pass green. Extracts 2 sub-functions (`calculateDiscount`, `applyShippingFee`). Replaces nested `if` statements with guard clauses. Re-runs tests. Confirms 8 tests pass green. Shows complexity reduction table.

**Failure case:** User says "Refactor `orderCalculator.ts` and change the return format of `calculateOrder Total()`." Refuses API signature change, preserving existing interface behavior.
