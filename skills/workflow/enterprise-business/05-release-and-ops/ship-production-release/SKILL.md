# Ship Production Release

## 0. Identity

- **Role:** Principal Release & Release Engineering Lead. Prepares, validates, tags, and executes production software releases with pre-flight checks, changelog generation, and rollback plans.
- **Authority:** Tier-5 Enterprise Skill. Governs release readiness validation, changelog compilation, version tagging, and production release sign-off.
- **Must not define:** Direct infrastructure provisioning or unauthorized secret key modifications.
- **Normative base:** `rules/common/general-rules.md`, `rules/engineering/architecture-boundaries.md`, `rules/common/code-style-standards.md`, `rules/common/code-style-standards.md`.
- **Anti-pattern gate:** This skill must never encode anti-patterns AP-1AP-56 from `references/anti-patterns.md`. Any step that could violate AP-4 (over-permissive agent), AP-26 (no scope boundary), AP-28 (no stop condition), AP-44 (unlocked filesystem), or AP-45 (no human review trigger) is forbidden.

## 1. Intent (9 Dimensions)

| #   | Dimension        | Value                                                                                                                   |
| --- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Task             | Verify release readiness, compile release notes, validate passing CI builds, tag release, and create rollback strategy. |
| 2   | Target Tool      | Any agent runtime: Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro, Cline, or raw API.                                     |
| 3   | Output Format    | Release summary report saved to `projects/<project-name>/context/releases/[version]-release-plan.md` and semantic version git tag.             |
| 4   | Constraints      | Must verify 100% green test suite. Must require explicit human approval before applying git tag or deploying.           |
| 5   | Input            | Target semantic version tag, release commits, open PR list, test execution logs, and rollback procedures.               |
| 6   | Context          | Prevents broken production releases, untagged deployments, and unrecoverable outage scenarios.                          |
| 7   | Audience         | Release engineers, SREs, developers, product managers, and engineering executives.                                      |
| 8   | Success Criteria | Release pre-flight checks pass green, changelog compiled, explicit approval received, release tagged.                   |
| 9   | Examples         | See Section 10.                                                                                                         |

## 2. Trigger Matrix

| Trigger                                               | Fire? | Notes                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Ship production release v2.4.0"                      | YES   | Primary trigger for release engineering.                  |
| "Prepare release notes and tag version"               | YES   | Release preparation request.                              |
| "Perform pre-flight checks for production deployment" | YES   | Pre-flight validation request.                            |
| "Design database schema migration"                    | NO    | Architecture task. Route to `design-system-architecture`. |
| "Audit frontend accessibility"                        | NO    | QA task. Route to `verify-accessibility-compliance`.      |

## 3. Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Pre-Flight Verification Gate

- **Action:** Run workspace build commands, type checkers, and test suites. Confirm that the main branch builds without warnings or errors and all tests pass green.
- **Input:** Target release commit on the main branch.
- **Stop Condition:** If any test fails or type check errors exist, abort the release workflow immediately and report blockers.
- **Validation:** Pre-flight status green confirmed.

### Step 2: Changelog Compilation & Artifact Drafting

- **Action:** Read commit messages and merged pull requests since the previous release tag. Categorize changes into Features (`feat`), Fixes (`fix`), Security (`sec`), and Breaking Changes (`breaking`).
- **Input:** Git commit log delta between previous tag and current HEAD.
- **Stop Condition:** If unreviewed breaking changes are detected without major version bump, flag for team review.
- **Validation:** Standardized markdown changelog drafted.

### Step 3: Rollback Strategy & Verification Specification

- **Action:** Document the explicit step-by-step rollback procedure (for example, git revert commit hash, database migration rollback commands, container image rollback tags).
- **Input:** Application architecture context and release scope.
- **Stop Condition:** Require explicit rollback command sequence before finalizing the release plan.
- **Validation:** Rollback plan fully documented.

### Step 4: Human Approval & Release Tag Execution

- **Action:** Write the release execution document to `projects/<project-name>/context/releases/[version]-release-plan.md`. Present the pre-flight results and prompt you for final explicit human confirmation before executing `git tag` or deployment commands.
- **Input:** Drafted changelog and rollback plan from Steps 23.
- **Stop Condition:** Pause for explicit human confirmation. Do NOT execute `git tag` or trigger production deployment without user sign-off.
- **Validation:** Release plan document saved and explicit sign-off received.

## 4. Output Specification

````markdown
# Production Release Plan: [vX.Y.Z]

- **Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Release Lead:** [Principal Release & Release Engineering Lead]
- **Target Version:** `vX.Y.Z`
- **Release Plan Path:** `projects/<project-name>/context/releases/[version]-release-plan.md`
- **Pre-flight Status:** GREEN (All Tests & Builds Passed)

## 1. Release Changelog Summary

### Added Features (`feat`)

- `feat(auth)`: Support multi-factor authentication via TOTP (#102)

### Bug Fixes (`fix`)

- `fix(db)`: Resolve connection pool exhaustion under high concurrency (#108)

### Security Enhancements (`sec`)

- `sec(deps)`: Upgrade `jsonwebtoken` to version `9.0.0` (#114)

## 2. Step-by-Step Rollback Plan

1. **Trigger Condition:** Error rate exceeds 1% or latency p95 > 2.0s post-release.
2. **Git Revert:** Run `git revert -m 1 [release-commit-sha]`.
3. **Container Rollback:** Redeploy previous docker image tag `vX.Y.(Z-1)`.
4. **Database Rollback:** Execute `npm run db:migrate:down`.

## 3. Pre-Flight Verification Log

```bash
$ npm test && npm run build
PASS src/index.test.ts (3.2 s)
Build completed successfully. Zero errors.
```
````

## 4. Final Sign-off Gate

- [x] All automated tests pass green.
- [x] Changelog compiled and verified.
- [x] Rollback plan documented.
- [ ] Explicit human sign-off confirmed before tag execution.

```

## 5. Validation Gate

Run before declaring completion:

- [ ] Pre-flight build and test run verified green.
- [ ] Commit delta scanned and changelog categorized.
- [ ] Explicit rollback instructions documented.
- [ ] Release plan saved to `projects/<project-name>/context/releases/[version]-release-plan.md`.
- [ ] Explicit human approval received before executing release tag commands.
- [ ] Zero banned words or em dashes present in response text.

## 6. Anti-Triggers and Calibration

- **Under-execution threshold:** Tagging a release without running tests or documenting rollback procedures.
- **Over-execution threshold:** Executing production tags or deployments without waiting for explicit human confirmation.
- **Calibration default:** Err on the side of caution. Require explicit sign-off prior to tag creation.

## 7. Anti-Pattern Compliance

| Step | Prevents AP | Mechanism |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Step 1 | AP-3, AP-48 | Enforces green build and test baseline before release preparation. |
| Step 2 | AP-1, AP-42 | Categorizes commit history into structured changelog formats. |
| Step 3 | AP-28 | Enforces pre-documented rollback sequence prior to execution. |
| Step 4 | AP-45 | Pauses for mandatory human review and sign-off before tagging. |

## 8. Versioning & Changelog

- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Changelog:**
  - `1.0.0`: Initial clean-room implementation conforming to Tier-5 Enterprise SKILL standard.

## 9. Portability Matrix

| Runtime | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Claude Code | verified | Direct execution using git tools. |
| Cursor | verified | Fully supported via workspace release manager. |
| Copilot | verified | Formatted for step-by-step release guidance. |
| Windsurf | verified | Fully compatible. |
| Kiro | verified | Fully compatible. |
| Cline | verified | Executed and verified in local workspace. |
| Raw API (no tooling) | verified | Generates valid release plan payloads. |

## 10. Examples

**Input:** "Prepare production release v1.2.0 for our backend service."

**Output:** Runs `npm test` and `npm run build`. Compiles commit delta into changelog. Formulates rollback plan. Saves `projects/<project-name>/context/releases/v1.2.0-release-plan.md`. Prompts: "Pre-flight checks passed. Please approve to execute `git tag v1.2.0`."

**Failure case:** User says "Push tag v1.2.0 directly to main even though 2 unit tests are failing." Refuses request due to failing pre-flight test gate.
