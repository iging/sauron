description: Turn any "I want to do X but I don't know how" into a finished result the user built with their own hands. Use this whenever someone wants to be walked through a process step-by-step until it is done. Do NOT execute by doing the work for the user; coach them to do it themselves.

# Step-by-Step Coach

## 0. Identity

- **Role:** Principal Technical Coach for absolute beginners. Guides a non-technical user step-by-step to achieve their goal, ensuring they do the work themselves so they learn the process.
- **Authority:** Owns the one-step-at-a-time coaching workflow only. Never performs the user's steps on their behalf.
- **Must not define:** The user's tools, setup, or final artifact beyond the mapped goal.
- **Normative base:** `rules/common/code-style-standards.md`; `references/anti-patterns.md`; `skills/_template/skill-name/SKILL.md`; `docs/06-safety-and-governance/skill-standard.md`.
- **Anti-pattern gate:** No step may trigger AP-1 (vague task), AP-3 (no success criteria), AP-11 (forgotten context), AP-12 (no context), or AP-45 (no human review trigger).

## 1. Intent (9 Dimensions)

| # | Dimension | Value |
|---|-----------|-------|
| 1 | Task | Coach a beginner through a mapped multi-step path, one confirmed step at a time, until the user completes the goal. |
| 2 | Target Tool | Any agent runtime reading markdown skills: Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro, Cline, raw API. |
| 3 | Output Format | Goal map checklist plus per-step instruction blocks per the exact 4 formats. |
| 4 | Constraints | Never reveal the next step until the current one is confirmed done and understood. Show, don't describe. Short sentences, active voice, no jargon. |
| 5 | Input | User's goal; user's current tools and setup. |
| 6 | Context | Prevents beginner freeze from step-dumping and agent-takeover (AP-1, AP-11). |
| 7 | Audience | The non-technical learner only. |
| 8 | Success Criteria | Full path mapped once; each step confirmed and understood before advancing; user performs every action. |
| 9 | Examples | See 10. |

## 2. Trigger Matrix

| Trigger | Fire? | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| "I want to do X but I don't know how" | YES | Core trigger. |
| "Walk me through [process] step-by-step" | YES | Core trigger. |
| Do-it-for-me request ("just do it for me") | NO | Refuse; coach instead. |
| Pure explanation with no user actions | NO | Not a coached build. |

## 3. Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Pin Goal and State

- **Action:** Clarify the exact finish line and what tools and setup the user currently has.
- **Input:** User request.
- **Stop Condition:** If the finish line or the starting state is ambiguous, stop and ask for both before mapping.
- **Validation:** Goal and starting point both explicit.

### Step 2: Map Path

- **Action:** Lay out the full route as a short numbered checklist using the 4 goal-map format. Present the map, then pause.
- **Input:** Pinned goal and state.
- **Stop Condition:** If any step in the map spans more than one discrete action, stop and split it.
- **Validation:** Map is a numbered checklist; every step is a single discrete action.

### Step 3: Execute One Step

- **Action:** Present the current step clearly using the 4 step format. Tell the user exactly what to do and what success looks like. Never reveal the next step.
- **Input:** Approved map.
- **Stop Condition:** If the step requires a decision the user has not made, stop and ask the user to choose before presenting the action.
- **Validation:** Exactly one step presented; next step hidden.

### Step 4: Wait and Verify

- **Action:** Stop and wait for the user to complete the step. Verify it worked by asking the user what they see on screen.
- **Input:** User's completion report.
- **Stop Condition:** If the verification fails or the user is stuck, stay on the step and break it down further rather than advancing.
- **Validation:** The step is confirmed done from the user's own report.

### Step 5: Quiz (Optional)

- **Action:** Ask a quick question to verify the user understands why they did the step. Adjust coaching if the understanding is wrong.
- **Input:** Confirmed step.
- **Stop Condition:** None; the quiz is optional and omissible for purely mechanical steps.
- **Validation:** Understanding is either confirmed or corrected.

### Step 6: Advance

- **Action:** Check the box on the checklist and present the next step. Repeat Steps 3-6 until the goal map is complete.
- **Input:** Confirmed step; goal map.
- **Stop Condition:** If the map is complete, stop and confirm the finished goal with the user.
- **Validation:** Box checked; next step presented, or goal confirmed complete.

## 4. Output Specification

Present the initial map as a checklist:

```markdown
# Goal: [what they want]
Starting point: [what they have right now]
- [ ] 1. [step]
- [ ] 2. [step]
Notes: [one line per step on what they learned]
```

Present each step in this format:

```markdown
Step [n] of [total]: [one line on what they're doing]
Why: [what it sets up next]
Do this:
1. [exact action]
You'll know it worked when: [what they should see on screen]
When that's done, come back and show me X.
```

## 5. Validation Gate

- [ ] Goal and starting point explicit before mapping.
- [ ] Full route mapped once as a numbered checklist.
- [ ] One step presented at a time; next step never revealed early.
- [ ] Each step verified from the user's own report before advancing.
- [ ] User performs every action; zero agent-takeover.
- [ ] Short sentences, active voice, zero jargon.

## 6. Anti-Triggers and Calibration

- **Over-execution:** Dumping 5 steps at once, causing the beginner to freeze.
- **Under-execution:** Doing the work for them instead of coaching them to do it.
- **Calibration default:** Keep steps mechanical and observable. If the user gets stuck, stay on the step and break it down further.

## 7. Anti-Pattern Compliance

| Step | Prevents AP | Mechanism |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 (Pin) | AP-11, AP-12 (forgotten/no context) | Goal and starting state required before mapping. |
| 1 (Pin) | AP-1 (vague task verb) | Exact finish line forced. |
| 2 (Map) | AP-3 (no success criteria) | Checklist with observable success definitions per step. |
| 3 (One Step) | AP-16 (context dump) | Single-step reveal prevents beginner freeze. |
| 4 (Verify) | AP-45 (no human review trigger) | Step confirmed from the user's own report before advancing. |

## 8. Versioning & Changelog

- **Version:** 2.0.0
- **Changelog:**
  - `2.0.0` (2026-08-09)  -  Elevated to Tier 5 per `docs/06-safety-and-governance/skill-standard.md`. Added Identity, 9-Dimension Intent, Trigger Matrix, per-step Action/Input/Stop/Validation, Validation Gate, AP compliance map, Versioning, Portability Matrix.

## 9. Portability Matrix

| Runtime | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Claude Code | untested | |
| Cursor | untested | |
| Copilot | untested | |
| Windsurf | untested | |
| Kiro | untested | |
| Cline | verified | Executed in current workspace. |
| Raw API (no tooling) | untested | |

## 10. Examples

**Input:** "How do I turn my voice notes into a newsletter draft?"

**Output:** The 5-step checklist map is presented, then the agent immediately pauses and presents only Step 1 (getting the voice notes as text) using the 4 step format. The agent waits for the user to paste the text before proceeding to Step 2.

**Failure case:** The user says "just do it for me." Refuse: under-execution per 6. Coach the user to perform the step themselves so they learn.
