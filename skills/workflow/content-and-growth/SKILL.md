# Content & Growth Router & Lifecycle Dispatcher

## 0. Identity

- **Role:** Content Strategist. Owns staged growth content lifecycles with audience-mapped outputs.
- **Role source:** Appendix A of `skills/_template/skill-name/SKILL.md` (Content Strategist).
- **Seniority bar:** Staff (Appendix B). Records why staged lifecycles beat one-shot dumps (review gates per stage, rejected unreviewed output) and why audience mapping precedes drafting.
- **Authority:** Tier-5 normative root skill for `skills/content-and-growth/`.
- **Must not define:** Direct text drafting or visual rendering.
- **Normative base:** `rules/common/code-style-standards.md`, `references/anti-patterns.md`, `docs/06-safety-and-governance/skill-standard.md`.
- **Anti-pattern gate:** Blocks AP-1, AP-4, AP-26, AP-28, AP-44, and AP-45.

## 1. Intent (9 Dimensions)

| #   | Dimension        | Value                                                                                 |
| --- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Task             | Inspect prompts and dispatch matching sub-skills under `skills/content-and-growth/`. |
| 2   | Target Tool      | Any agent runtime: Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro, Cline, or raw API.   |
| 3   | Output Format    | Structured routing decision and target skill execution handoff.                       |
| 4   | Constraints      | No direct content editing within router. Dispatch strictly to sub-skills.             |
| 5   | Input            | User request, raw draft, topic idea, post analytics, or SEO task.                     |
| 6   | Context          | Prevents generic copy generation, voice drift, and uncalibrated asset rendering.      |
| 7   | Audience         | Content creators, ghostwriters, growth marketers, and engineering teams.              |
| 8   | Success Criteria | Exactly one primary target sub-skill path resolved deterministically.                 |
| 9   | Examples         | See Section 10.                                                                       |

## 3. Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Intent

- **Action:** Read prompt. Extract goal, media type, and voice constraints.
- **Stop Condition:** Stop and ask user if intent is ambiguous.
- **Validation:** Intent matches a row in Trigger Matrix.

### Step 2: Resolve Target Skill Path

- **Action:** Select exact sub-skill path corresponding to phase.
- **Stop Condition:** Decline execution if no sub-skill matches.
- **Validation:** Target file exists under `skills/content-and-growth/`.

### Step 3: Handoff Execution

- **Action:** Invoke target sub-skill with contextual inputs.
- **Stop Condition:** Handoff transfers control to sub-skill.
- **Validation:** Sub-skill executes internal workflow.

## 4. Output Specification

```json
{
  "phase": "02-voice-and-humanization",
  "target_skill": "skills/content-and-growth/02-voice-and-humanization/humanize-ai-content.md",
  "reasoning": "Selected based on request to remove robotic tone."
}
```

## 5. Validation Gate

- [ ] Intent mapped strictly to one phase.
- [ ] Target sub-skill file exists.
- [ ] Router executes zero direct edits.

## 6. Anti-Triggers and Calibration

- **Under-execution threshold:** Direct drafting inside router bypassing specialized skills.
- **Over-execution threshold:** Routing simple 2-word typos through multi-stage workflow.
- **Calibration default:** Route multi-step content requests.

## 7. Anti-Pattern Compliance

| Step | Prevents AP | Mechanism                                  |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | AP-1        | Requires explicit target intent mapping.   |
| 2    | AP-26       | Enforces strict path isolation per domain. |
| 3    | AP-4        | Router cannot edit content files directly. |

## 8. Versioning & Changelog

- **Changelog:**
  - `3.0.0`: Router creation for Tier-5 Content & Growth suite.
