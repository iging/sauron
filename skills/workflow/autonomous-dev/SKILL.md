# Autonomous Dev Router & Lifecycle Dispatcher

## 0. Identity

- **Role:** Pipeline Builder. Owns staged development lifecycle topology from ideation through quality gates.
- **Role source:** Appendix A of `skills/_template/skill-name/SKILL.md` (Pipeline Builder).
- **Seniority bar:** Staff (Appendix B). Records why staged lifecycles beat monolithic runs (gates catch drift per stage, rejected end-to-end hope) and why dispatcher ownership stays explicit per stage.
- **Authority:** Normative root tier for `skills/workflow/autonomous-dev/`.
- **Must not define:** Direct file edits or coding execution, routing logic hands off execution to specialized skills.
- **Normative base:** `core/fellowship/frodo.md`, `rules/languages/typescript-strict.md`, `rules/common/code-style-standards.md`, `rules/engineering/architecture-boundaries.md`, `rules/engineering/defensive-programming.md`, `references/anti-patterns.md`.
- **Anti-pattern gate:** Blocks AP-4, AP-26, AP-28, AP-44, and AP-45.

## 1. Intent (9 Dimensions)

| #   | Dimension        | Value                                                                                 |
| --- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Task             | Classify user requests into lifecycle phases and dispatch matching sub-skills.        |
| 2   | Target Tool      | Any agent runtime: Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro, Cline, or raw API.   |
| 3   | Output Format    | Structured routing decision and target skill execution handoff.                       |
| 4   | Constraints      | No direct code edits within the router. Dispatch to sub-skill files.                  |
| 5   | Input            | User intent, prompt requests, feature ideas, bug reports, or pull requests.           |
| 6   | Context          | Prevents premature code editing, context drift, and uncoordinated subagent execution. |
| 7   | Audience         | Autonomous agents and developers executing engineering tasks.                         |
| 8   | Success Criteria | Exactly one primary target sub-skill path resolved and invoked deterministically.     |
| 9   | Examples         | See Section 10.                                                                       |

## 3. Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Intent

- **Action:** Read user prompt. Extract goal, scope, and technical target.
- **Input:** User prompt text.
- **Stop Condition:** Stop and ask user if intent is ambiguous.
- **Validation:** Intent matches a row in the Trigger Matrix.

### Step 2: Resolve Target Skill Path

- **Action:** Select exact sub-skill path corresponding to the identified phase.
- **Input:** Trigger Matrix table.
- **Stop Condition:** Decline execution if no sub-skill matches.
- **Validation:** Target file exists under `skills/workflow/autonomous-dev/`.

### Step 3: Handoff Execution

- **Action:** Invoke target sub-skill with contextual inputs.
- **Input:** Resolved sub-skill path.
- **Stop Condition:** Handoff transfers control to sub-skill.
- **Validation:** Sub-skill executes internal workflow.

## 4. Output Specification

```json
{
  "phase": "01-ideation-and-design",
  "target_skill": "skills/workflow/autonomous-dev/01-ideation-and-design/brainstorming/SKILL.md",
  "reasoning": "Selected based on intent matching criteria."
}
```

## 5. Validation Gate

- [ ] User intent mapped to exactly one lifecycle phase.
- [ ] Target sub-skill file exists on disk.
- [ ] Router executes no code or file edits directly.

## 6. Anti-Triggers and Calibration

- **Under-execution threshold:** Failing to route leads to uncoordinated code edits.
- **Over-execution threshold:** Routing single-line trivial fixes like typo corrections.
- **Calibration default:** Route multi-step tasks, execute single-line edits directly.

## 7. Anti-Pattern Compliance

| Step | Prevents AP                  | Mechanism                                       |
| ---- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | AP-1 (vague task)            | Requires goal clarification before dispatching. |
| 2    | AP-26 (no scope boundary)    | Maps intent strictly to dedicated sub-skills.   |
| 3    | AP-4 (over-permissive agent) | Router cannot edit files directly.              |
