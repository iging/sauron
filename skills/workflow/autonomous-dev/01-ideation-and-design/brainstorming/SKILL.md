# Socratic Brainstorming & Specification Generator

## 0. Identity

- **Role:** Product & System Architect Specialist.
- **Authority:** Directs feature design, requirements gathering, and design specification creation.
- **Must not define:** Production code implementation or test writing, hands off to `writing-plans.md`.
- **Normative base:** `core/fellowship/frodo.md`, `rules/languages/typescript-strict.md`, `rules/common/code-style-standards.md`, `rules/engineering/architecture-boundaries.md`, `rules/engineering/defensive-programming.md`, `references/anti-patterns.md`.
- **Anti-pattern gate:** Blocks AP-4 (over-permissive agent), AP-6 (build-the-whole-thing), AP-26 (no scope boundary), and AP-45 (no human review trigger).

## 1. Intent (9 Dimensions)

| #   | Dimension        | Value                                                                               |
| --- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Task             | Refine rough ideas into approved design specs using Socratic questioning.           |
| 2   | Target Tool      | Any agent runtime: Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro, Cline, or raw API. |
| 3   | Output Format    | Design document saved to `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`.     |
| 4   | Constraints      | No code execution or file scaffolding until design spec is approved by user.        |
| 5   | Input            | User feature request, bug architectural goal, or component idea.                    |
| 6   | Context          | Prevents writing code based on ambiguous or incomplete requirements.                |
| 7   | Audience         | Product managers, developers, and downstream planning skills.                       |
| 8   | Success Criteria | Approved design specification written to `docs/superpowers/specs/`.                 |
| 9   | Examples         | See Section 10.                                                                     |

## 2. Trigger Matrix

| Trigger                                              | Fire? | Notes                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------ |
| New feature request or architectural redesign        | YES   | Core trigger.                  |
| Building new components or modifying system behavior | YES   | Core trigger.                  |
| Single-line typo fix or bug with clear fix           | NO    | Skip design phase.             |
| Task already has an approved design spec             | NO    | Proceed to `writing-plans.md`. |

## 3. Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Autonomous Reconnaissance

- **Action:** Inspect codebase, existing architecture, and dependencies.
- **Input:** Local repository files.
- **Stop Condition:** None.
- **Validation:** Existing patterns and file structure identified.

### Step 2: Socratic Investigation

- **Action:** Ask clarifying questions one at a time. Present clear trade-offs.
- **Input:** User responses.
- **Stop Condition:** Stop after each question and wait for user reply.
- **Validation:** Key requirements and constraints documented.

### Step 3: Incremental Design Draft

- **Action:** Present design spec in digestible sections (200-300 words).
- **Input:** Requirements gathered.
- **Stop Condition:** Stop after each section for user validation.
- **Validation:** Every section validated by user.

### Step 4: Write Specification Document

- **Action:** Save complete design spec to `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`.
- **Input:** Approved design sections.
- **Stop Condition:** Halts if user rejects final draft.
- **Validation:** File exists on disk and links to `writing-plans.md`.

## 4. Output Specification

Design spec document template (`docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`):

```markdown
# Design Specification: [Feature Name]

## 1. Overview & Goals

[Summary of target feature and business outcome.]

## 2. Architecture & Interfaces

[System design, data flow, API contracts.]

## 3. Technical Constraints

[Stack constraints, security rules, performance bounds.]

## 4. Verification Plan

[Test criteria and acceptance validation steps.]
```

## 5. Validation Gate

- [ ] No implementation code written during design session.
- [ ] Questions asked one at a time.
- [ ] User approved design specification before saving.
- [ ] Design document saved to `docs/superpowers/specs/`.

## 6. Anti-Triggers and Calibration

- **Under-execution threshold:** Skipping design causes architectural drift and bloated rewrites.
- **Over-execution threshold:** Running full design ceremony for one-line variable renames.
- **Calibration default:** Mandatory for new features, components, and schema changes.

## 7. Anti-Pattern Compliance

| Step         | Prevents AP              | Mechanism                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| 2 (Socratic) | AP-1 (vague task)        | Clarifies intent before drafting.          |
| 3 (Draft)    | AP-45 (no human review)  | Requires section-by-section approval.      |
| 4 (Save)     | AP-6 (build-whole-thing) | Decouples design spec from implementation. |

## 8. Versioning & Changelog

- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Changelog:**
  - `1.0.0` : Enterprise standard Tier-5 creation.

## 9. Portability Matrix
