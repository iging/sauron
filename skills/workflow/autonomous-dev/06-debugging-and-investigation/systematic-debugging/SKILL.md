# Systematic Debugging & Root Cause Analysis Engine

## 0. Identity

- **Role:** Root Cause Investigation & Debugging Specialist.
- **Authority:** Enforces hypothesis-driven debugging and test pollution bisection protocols.
- **Must not define:** Unverified guesses or random trial-and-error code edits.
- **Normative base:** `core/fellowship/frodo.md`, `rules/languages/typescript-strict.md`, `rules/common/code-style-standards.md`, `rules/engineering/architecture-boundaries.md`, `rules/engineering/defensive-programming.md`, `references/anti-patterns.md`.
- **Anti-pattern gate:** Blocks AP-1, AP-4, AP-9, AP-26, AP-28, AP-44, and AP-45.

## 1. Intent (9 Dimensions)

| #   | Dimension        | Value                                                                                   |
| --- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Task             | Investigate bugs, test failures, and regressions using systematic 4-phase debugging.    |
| 2   | Target Tool      | Any agent runtime: Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro, Cline, or raw API.     |
| 3   | Output Format    | Minimal reproduction script, isolated root cause analysis, and regression test.         |
| 4   | Constraints      | Must not edit production code until minimal reproduction script is written and fails.   |
| 5   | Input            | Bug description, failing test log, or unexpected behavior report.                       |
| 6   | Context          | Prevents speculative code editing, introducing secondary bugs, and unverified fixes.    |
| 7   | Audience         | Autonomous agents and software engineers.                                               |
| 8   | Success Criteria | Root cause isolated, reproduction test fails initially, fix passes test and full suite. |
| 9   | Examples         | See Section 10.                                                                         |

## 2. Trigger Matrix

| Trigger                                       | Fire? | Notes                                         |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Unexpected test failure, crash, or bug report | YES   | Core trigger.                                 |
| Flaky test or test order pollution failure    | YES   | Core trigger.                                 |
| Feature request with known working code       | NO    | Use `brainstorming.md` or `writing-plans.md`. |
| Implementation task progressing normally      | NO    | Continue TDD cycle.                           |

## 3. Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Minimal Reproduction

- **Action:** Write a minimal automated test or script reproducing the bug deterministically.
- **Input:** Bug report and stack traces.
- **Stop Condition:** Halt if reproduction script cannot reproduce the issue reliably.
- **Validation:** Script fails consistently with target error.

### Step 2: Isolation & Bisection

- **Action:** Trace stack frames backwards or run test bisection (`skills/workflow/autonomous-dev/references/systematic-debugging-tools.md`).
- **Input:** Failing execution trace.
- **Stop Condition:** Halt once exact state divergence line is pinpointed.
- **Validation:** Precise file, line, and state variable identified.

### Step 3: Formulate & Test Hypothesis

- **Action:** State explicit hypothesis for failure mechanism. Test hypothesis using minimal diagnostic edit.
- **Input:** State divergence line.
- **Stop Condition:** If hypothesis test disproves mechanism, reformulate hypothesis before editing code.
- **Validation:** Hypothesis confirmed by diagnostic output.

### Step 4: Targeted Fix & Regression Proof

- **Action:** Apply targeted fix. Verify reproduction test passes and full test suite remains green.
- **Input:** Verified hypothesis.
- **Stop Condition:** Halt if fix causes regressions in external modules.
- **Validation:** Reproduction test passes and complete test runner exits with code 0.

## 4. Output Specification

```markdown
# Root Cause Analysis & Resolution

- **Bug Summary:** `TokenValidator throws TypeError on null authorization header`
- **Minimal Reproduction:** `tests/bugs/issue-104.test.ts`
- **Root Cause:** Missing null check on incoming request headers object.
- **Fix Applied:** Added safe navigation check in `src/auth/validator.ts:42`.
- **Regression Verification:** Full test suite passed (52 tests).
```

## 5. Validation Gate

- [ ] Minimal reproduction script created and verified failing before code edit.
- [ ] Root cause state divergence pinpointed to exact file and line number.
- [ ] Explicit hypothesis stated and confirmed before applying permanent fix.
- [ ] Full test suite passes after applying fix.

## 6. Anti-Triggers and Calibration

- **Under-execution threshold:** Applying speculative patches without reproduction introduces secondary bugs.
- **Over-execution threshold:** Running 4-phase bisection for clear syntax errors reported by compiler.
- **Calibration default:** Mandatory for runtime crashes, flaky tests, and logic bugs.

## 7. Anti-Pattern Compliance

| Step | Prevents AP                  | Mechanism                                                     |
| ---- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | AP-9 (no verification)       | Enforces deterministic reproduction before editing logic.     |
| 3    | AP-1 (vague task)            | Demands explicit hypothesis formulation and test.             |
| 4    | AP-4 (over-permissive agent) | Validates fix against full test suite to prevent regressions. |

## 8. Versioning & Changelog
